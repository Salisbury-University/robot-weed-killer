# Weight Distribution in New Chassis

## FRONT END:

```Weight of laser: 13.1 oz```


## REAR END:

* Weight of lead cylinder, 3cm diameter, 1cm height: 2.8 oz
* 2x lead cylinder = 4.7 oz
* Arduino mega weight: 1.2 oz
* Power cell weight: 10.4 oz

#### Weight distribution: 13.1 vs 10.4 = 24% more weight on rear end
#### Weight distribution is calculated based on equipment, not weight of chassis or motors & wheels
