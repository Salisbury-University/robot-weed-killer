------------
#Week 1
9/12 - 12:15pm - 12:45pm
First Client Meeting

Meeting Progress:
- Gain an understanding of our project concept and goal
- Ask questions about the project (software & hardware)

#Week 2
9/19 - 12:15pm - 12:45pm
Client Meeting

Meeting Progress:
- Gain more clarification on project goal
- Propose a concept and language & framework to client
- Approval for use to start our work

9/19 - 2:30pm - 4pm
Group Work Meeting

Meeting Progress:
- Analyze state of robotic hardware
- Robot can move, flimsy but working
- Wiring is spaghetti-esque, took pictures in case we need to cable manage later
- Arduino has test code to move backwards, forwards, and turn
- Tested our lasers capabilities
- Setup IDEâ€™s and installed dependencies for creating application

#Week 3
9/26 - 12:15pm - 12:45pm
Client Meeting

Meeting Progress:
- Discussed with client about updates to robot hardware
- Talked progress of control program (first creating barebones control through cmd)
- Client is ordering bluetooth module for integration with application wireless control

9/28 - 2:15 - 4:30pm
Group Work Meeting

Meeting Progress:
- Sturdied up robot hardware
- Completed and demonstrated robot control code (Python on PC)
- Setup and installed test app on Android phone


10/3 - 12:15pm - 12:30pm
Client Meeting

Meeting Progress:
- Showed project progress (serial control)
- Noted feedback of app design ideas (camera, joystick, dual-directional movement)
- Requested new hardware for bluetooth control

10/4 - 1:50pm - 3:05pm
Team Meeting (Class Hours)

Meeting Progress:
- Research into APIs in which to connect our python script to our React interface
